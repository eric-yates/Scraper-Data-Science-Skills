### Installing

If your computer does not already have Python 2.7 installed, download Python 2.7 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

By default, Python should come with pip (a package manager). Use it to install the following dependencies by opening the Terminal and entering the commands as follows for each of the prerequisites:
